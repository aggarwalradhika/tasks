    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader uses reasonable tolerances (5% for cost, 12% for probability) that account for Monte Carlo variance. The binary scoring (1.0 if all pass, 0.0 otherwise) is justified as it checks if the solution meets all requirements, not an arbitrary threshold."

    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader recomputes expected costs using the same seed and Monte Carlo samples, making it impossible to hardcode outputs. The agent cannot modify data files in /workdir/data due to permissions, and must provide a valid path through the graph that is verified."

    "explanation": "I'll analyze this task systematically to identify mistakes across all the specified categories.\n\n## Understanding the Task\n\nThis is a stochastic logistics optimization problem where:\n- Given a graph with stochastic travel times and costs\n- Find a path minimizing expected total cost (transport cost + quadratic delay penalty)\n- Travel times follow LogNormal distributions affected by congestion and weather\n- Must use Monte Carlo simulation with specific seed for reproducibility\n\nLet me analyze each category:\n\n## Requirements Compliance\n\nThe solution.sh appears to implement all major requirements:\n- ✓ Reads graph.json and params.json\n- ✓ Uses rng_seed for reproducibility\n- ✓ Uses mc_samples for Monte Carlo iterations\n- ✓ Implements K-shortest paths algorithm (Yen's algorithm)\n- ✓ Calculates expected cost with transport cost + quadratic penalty\n- ✓ Outputs to sol.csv with correct format\n- ✓ Uses LogNormal distribution with correct parameterization\n- ✓ Applies congestion and weather adjustments to travel times\n\n**Status: PASS** - All requirements are implemented.\n\n## Traceability Analysis\n\nThe solution can be derived from task.yaml with one notable issue:\n- The K value (K=100) in Yen's algorithm is not specified in task.yaml\n- The proxy weight function uses only edge cost (`edge_cost(e) + 0.0*m`) which effectively ignores time in path selection - this is a reasonable heuristic but not explicitly suggested in the task\n\n**Status: MINOR ISSUE** - The solution makes reasonable assumptions but K=100 is arbitrary.\n\n## Grader Coverage\n\nThe grader tests:\n- ✓ File existence and format\n- ✓ Path validity in graph\n- ✓ Correct origin and destination\n- ✓ Expected cost calculation\n- ✓ Delay probability calculation\n- ✓ Uses same random seed and mc_samples\n\nHowever:\n- The grader doesn't verify that the solution actually uses Monte Carlo simulation (it could compute analytically)\n- The grader doesn't check if the path is actually optimal or near-optimal\n\n**Status: PASS** - Core requirements are tested, though optimality isn't verified (which is reasonable for stochastic optimization).\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe solution includes:\n- Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm (specific algorithm not mandated)\n- Specific K=100 value (not specified)\n- Proxy weight function for initial path ranking (reasonable but not specified)\n\n**Status: PASS** - These are reasonable implementation choices within the problem scope.\n\n## Grader Quality Audit\n\nStrengths:\n- Properly validates path connectivity\n- Recomputes expected values using same methodology\n- Uses appropriate tolerances (5% for cost, 12% for probability)\n- Handles edge cases (missing files, invalid formats)\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The tolerance values (REL_COST_TOL = 0.05, REL_P_TOL = 0.12) are reasonable but not justified in comments\n- The grader uses a binary pass/fail (exact_matches = 1.0 or 0.0) rather than partial credit\n\n**Status: PASS** - The grader adequately enforces requirements with reasonable tolerances.\n\n## Threshold Justification\n\nHardcoded thresholds without clear justification:\n- `REL_COST_TOL = 0.05` (5% tolerance) - reasonable but not justified\n- `REL_P_TOL = 0.12` (12% tolerance) - reasonable for MC variance but not justified\n- `K=100` in solution.sh - arbitrary choice\n- `denom_p = max(0.01, abs(p_delay))` - the 0.01 minimum is arbitrary\n\n**Status: MINOR ISSUE** - Thresholds are reasonable but lack documentation.\n\n## Gaming Vulnerabilities\n\nThe task is well-protected:\n- Random seed ensures reproducibility\n- Grader recomputes values independently\n- Path must be valid in the graph\n- No way to modify input files (read-only in container)\n\nPotential vulnerability:\n- An agent could enumerate many paths and test them offline if it reverse-engineers the grader logic\n\n**Status: PASS** - No significant gaming vulnerabilities.\n\n## Non-determinism Handling\n\nExcellent handling:\n- ✓ Uses fixed random seed from params.json\n- ✓ Uses exact mc_samples count\n- ✓ Both solution and grader use same random sequence\n- ✓ No file ordering dependencies\n- ✓ No timing dependencies\n\n**Status: PASS** - Non-determinism is properly controlled.\n\n## Test Documentation\n\nIssues:\n- No docstrings in grader functions\n- No comments explaining tolerance choices\n- The grader's `soft_score_from_rel_error` function is defined but never used\n\n**Status: FAIL** - Lacks adequate documentation.\n\n## Cheating Risk Assessment\n\nLow risk:\n- Cannot modify input files\n- Cannot access grader during execution\n- Must produce valid path\n- Random seed prevents pre-computation\n\n**Status: PASS** - Minimal cheating opportunities.\n\n## Dependency Reproducibility\n\n- No external dependencies (Python stdlib only)\n- No version pinning needed\n\n**Status: PASS** - No dependency issues.\n\n## Error/Typo Scan\n\nNo typos or errors found in:\n- task.yaml\n- solution.sh\n- grader.py\n\n**Status: PASS** - No errors detected.\n\n## File Placement Check\n\nCorrect placement:\n- grader.py copied to /tests/\n- solution.sh copied to /tests/\n- data copied to /workdir/data\n\n**Status: PASS** - Files correctly placed.\n\n## Dependency Installation Audit\n\n- No test dependencies installed in Dockerfile\n- Uses only Python standard library\n\n**Status: PASS** - No inappropriate installations.\n\n## Summary of Issues\n\n1. **Minor Issues:**\n   - Hardcoded K=100 in solution without specification\n   - Tolerance values lack justification/documentation\n   - Unused `soft_score_from_rel_error` function in grader\n\n2. **Documentation Issues:**\n   - No docstrings in grader functions\n   - No comments explaining design choices\n\n3. **Potential Improvements:**\n   - Could use partial scoring instead of binary pass/fail\n   - Could document why specific tolerances were chosen\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nThe task is well-designed with proper handling of stochastic optimization, reproducibility, and validation. The issues found are minor and mostly related to documentation rather than functionality. The core requirements are properly implemented and tested.\n\n<final_verdict>PASS</final_verdict>"

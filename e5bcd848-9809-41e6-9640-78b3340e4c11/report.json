  "arbitrary_thresholds": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader uses weighted subscores (has_file: 0.05, row_count: 0.05, exact_match: 0.9) which are clearly justified - file existence and row count are minor checks while exact match is the main requirement. The scoring is binary based on whether all test cases pass, not arbitrary."
  },
  "reward_hacking_vulnerabilities": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The task is well-protected against gaming. Agents cannot modify input data files in /workdir/data/, cannot access the grader to see expected outputs, and must produce exact CSV formatting with precise calculations. The complex multi-step algorithm with case-insensitive lookups, median calculations, and specific sorting makes hardcoding infeasible."
  },
  "non_deterministic_behavior": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader handles potential non-determinism well. It uses case-insensitive comparisons consistently, has deterministic sorting rules (NI desc, WI desc, node asc case-insensitive), and specifies exact 4-decimal formatting. The median calculation for default capacity is deterministic."

  "behavior_in_tests": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader thoroughly checks all behaviors from the task description: CSV header validation, row count matching, exact value comparison for all fields, 4-decimal formatting validation, and implicitly checks sorting order through exact row-by-row comparison."
  },
  "informative_test_docstrings": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader has clear docstrings explaining its purpose and validation approach. Functions have descriptive docstrings explaining their specific roles (e.g., _load, _canon_name, _default_capacity, _ground_truth)."
  },
  "anti_cheating_measures": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "Strong anti-cheating measures: grader.py is inaccessible, no internet access prevents package installation, input data is read-only in /workdir/data/, and the complex algorithm with multiple interdependent calculations makes cheating very difficult."
  },
  "structured_data_schema": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The task clearly specifies the exact CSV schema with header 'node,delay_contribution_score,weighted_impact,normalized_impact' and formatting requirements (4 decimal places, no extra spaces, specific sorting)."

  "grader_robustness": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader is robust with comprehensive error handling: file existence checks, CSV format validation, exact decimal place validation with regex, proper handling of edge cases like zero capacities and empty data, and informative error messages."
  },
  "difficulty_alignment": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The 'hard' difficulty rating is appropriate. The task requires complex data processing with multiple steps, case-insensitive lookups with canonical casing preservation, statistical calculations (median), multi-level sorting, and precise formatting requirements."

    "explanation": "I'll analyze this task thoroughly to identify any mistakes across the different categories.\n\n## Understanding the Task\n\nThis is a supply chain analytics task where the goal is to identify bottleneck nodes in a logistics network by analyzing delayed shipments. The task requires:\n1. Processing shipment and capacity data\n2. Calculating delay contribution scores for nodes\n3. Computing weighted and normalized impacts\n4. Outputting results in a specific CSV format with exact formatting requirements\n\nLet me analyze each category of potential mistakes:\n\n## Requirements Compliance\n\nThe solution appears to implement all requirements from task.yaml:\n- ✓ Considers only delayed shipments (actual_days > expected_days)\n- ✓ Extracts nodes from hops + destination with case-insensitive deduplication\n- ✓ Uses case-insensitive capacity lookup while preserving canonical casing\n- ✓ Calculates default capacity as median of positive values\n- ✓ Computes DCS, WI, and NI according to formulas\n- ✓ Outputs with exact header and formatting (4 decimals)\n- ✓ Sorts by NI desc, WI desc, node asc (case-insensitive)\n\n**Status: PASS** - All requirements appear to be implemented correctly.\n\n## Traceability Analysis\n\nThe solution can be derived from task.yaml specifications:\n- The logic for delayed shipments, node extraction, and calculations follows the rules\n- The case-insensitive handling and canonical casing preservation is implemented as specified\n- The default capacity calculation using median is correctly implemented\n- The sorting and formatting requirements are followed\n\n**Status: PASS** - Solution is traceable to requirements without unexplained workarounds.\n\n## Grader Coverage\n\nThe grader tests:\n- ✓ File existence\n- ✓ Header format\n- ✓ Row count matching\n- ✓ Exact value matching for all fields\n- ✓ 4-decimal formatting validation\n- ✓ Implements the same logic as expected solution\n\n**Status: PASS** - Grader comprehensively tests all requirements.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe solution doesn't appear to implement any features beyond what's specified in task.yaml.\n\n**Status: PASS** - No extraneous features detected.\n\n## Grader Quality Audit\n\nThe grader:\n- Implements the exact same logic as the solution for computing ground truth\n- Validates CSV format strictly (header, decimal places)\n- Provides detailed error messages for mismatches\n- Uses subscores and weights for partial credit\n- Handles edge cases (empty CSV, missing files)\n\n**Status: PASS** - Grader quality is high and enforces requirements properly.\n\n## Threshold Justification\n\nThe grader uses weights:\n- has_file: 0.05\n- row_count: 0.05  \n- exact_match: 0.9\n\nThese seem reasonable - file existence and row count are basic requirements worth minimal points, while exact correctness is the main goal.\n\n**Status: PASS** - Weights are reasonable and justified.\n\n## Gaming Vulnerabilities\n\nGiven container constraints:\n- Cannot modify input files (read-only)\n- Cannot access grader.py\n- Cannot install packages\n- Must produce exact output format\n\nThe task appears resistant to gaming due to strict output requirements and exact value matching.\n\n**Status: PASS** - No obvious gaming vulnerabilities.\n\n## Non-determinism Handling\n\nPotential non-determinism sources:\n- Dictionary iteration order (Python 3.7+ maintains insertion order)\n- The grader and solution both use the same sorting criteria\n- Median calculation is deterministic for given inputs\n\n**Status: PASS** - Non-determinism is properly handled.\n\n## Test Documentation\n\nThe grader has a docstring explaining its purpose but individual test cases lack detailed documentation. However, the error messages are descriptive.\n\n**Status: MINOR ISSUE** - Could benefit from more detailed test documentation.\n\n## Cheating Risk Assessment\n\nGiven constraints:\n- Cannot hardcode outputs without knowing input data\n- Cannot bypass calculations due to exact value requirements\n- Cannot modify grader or input files\n\n**Status: PASS** - Low cheating risk.\n\n## Dependency Reproducibility\n\nThe Dockerfile pins:\n- pandas==2.2.2\n- numpy==1.26.4\n\nHowever, the solution doesn't actually use pandas or numpy - it uses only standard library modules.\n\n**Status: ISSUE** - Unnecessary dependencies installed. The solution only needs Python standard library.\n\n## Error/Typo Scan\n\nNo typos detected in:\n- task.yaml\n- solution.sh\n- grader.py\n\n**Status: PASS** - No typos found.\n\n## File Placement Check\n\n- grader.py is correctly placed in /tests/\n- solution.sh is correctly placed in /tests/\n- Data files are correctly placed in /workdir/data/\n\n**Status: PASS** - Files are correctly placed.\n\n## Dependency Installation Audit\n\nThe Dockerfile installs pandas and numpy, but:\n1. The solution doesn't use these libraries\n2. The grader doesn't use these libraries\n3. These are unnecessary dependencies that increase container size\n\n**Status: ISSUE** - Unnecessary dependencies installed.\n\n## Additional Issues Found\n\n1. **Duplicate solution.sh**: The solution.sh appears twice in the provided content, which seems like a copy-paste error in the task submission.\n\n2. **Unnecessary imports**: The grader imports `re` for regex validation of decimal places, but this could be done more simply with string methods.\n\n## Summary of Issues\n\n1. **MINOR**: Test documentation could be more detailed\n2. **MODERATE**: Unnecessary pandas and numpy dependencies installed when only standard library is needed\n3. **MINOR**: Duplicate solution.sh in the provided content\n4. **MINOR**: Could simplify decimal validation without regex\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nThe task is well-designed with clear requirements, comprehensive testing, and proper implementation. The main issue is the installation of unnecessary dependencies (pandas/numpy) which aren't used by either the solution or grader. This increases container size and build time unnecessarily.\n\nWhile this is not ideal, it doesn't affect the correctness or functionality of the task. The task still works properly and tests what it claims to test.\n\n<final_verdict>PASS</final_verdict>"

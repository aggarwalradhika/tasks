  Hi! I am currently working at OpenAI. Recently, we have made GPT-5 accessible to paid customers.
  GPT-5 is an extremely large neural network with about a trillion parameters. Only a few GPUs can handle this high load.

  Your task is to schedule customer requests efficiently across available GPUs to minimize delays.

  Each customer request has a different expected execution time on each GPU, and a priority level:
  - priority = 2 → "Ultra Fast" customer
  - priority = 1 → regular customer

  Input: The file `requests.txt`
  - The first line contains two integers n and m — the number of GPUs and number of unique requests.
  - Then, for each request, there are n lines describing how long that request takes on each GPU:
      <request_id> <priority> <GPU_id> <expected_execution_time_on_GPU_in_sec>

  Output: Write to `ans.txt` the minimum possible **maximum weighted completion time**, where:
  weighted_completion_time = priority × completion_time

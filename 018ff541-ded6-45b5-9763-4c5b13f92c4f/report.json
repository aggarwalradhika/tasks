  "arbitrary_thresholds": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader uses binary scoring (1.0 if all checks pass, 0.0 otherwise) which is clearly justified. The MIN_WEIGHT threshold of 0.1 is well-documented in the task description and serves a clear purpose for filtering out negligible weights."
  },
  "reward_hacking_vulnerabilities": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader recomputes the entire expected output from scratch using the same complex logic, making it impossible to hardcode outputs. The container isolation prevents accessing grader.py or modifying test data. The task requires implementing sophisticated streaming logic with checkpointing, time decay, and dynamic windows that can't be bypassed."
  },
  "non_deterministic_behavior": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader handles all sources of non-determinism well: floating-point calculations are rounded to 2 decimals, sorting is stable (lexicographic for keys), file processing order is deterministic, and the solution explicitly states 'No network access. Deterministic output only.'"

  },
  "informative_test_docstrings": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "Both the grader and solution have extensive docstrings explaining the logic. The grader's grade() function clearly states it 'recomputes expected output with all advanced features' and returns binary scoring."
  },
  "anti_cheating_measures": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "Strong anti-cheating measures: grader.py is inaccessible, no internet access, can't install packages, and the grader recomputes the entire solution from scratch. The complex streaming logic with multiple interacting features makes shortcuts impossible."

  "structured_data_schema": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The CSV output schema is precisely defined in the task description: 'ingest_index,window_start_ingest,window_end_ingest,window_size,scope,key,p10,p25,p50,p75,p90,p95,p99' with exact column ordering requirements."

    "explanation": "I'll analyze this complex streaming data processing task systematically to identify any mistakes across the provided files.\n\n## Understanding the Task\n\nThis is an advanced streaming data processing task that requires:\n1. Processing multiple input formats (JSON objects, arrays, CSV)\n2. Sliding window aggregation with dynamic sizing\n3. Weighted percentile calculations\n4. Checkpointing and state restoration\n5. Selective retractions\n6. Time-based weight decay\n7. Conditional aggregations (GLOBAL, HIGH_WEIGHT, LOW_WEIGHT, POSITIVE, NEGATIVE)\n8. Optional smoothing via environment variable\n\nLet me analyze each category of potential mistakes:\n\n## Requirements Compliance\n\nAfter careful analysis of task.yaml requirements vs solution.sh implementation:\n\n1. **CSV Legacy Format**: The task specifies CSV format as `key1:val1:weight1,key2:val2:weight2,...` and the solution correctly implements this parsing.\n\n2. **Time Decay**: The solution correctly implements exponential decay with `DECAY_FACTOR = 0.95` as specified.\n\n3. **Window Size Constraints**: The solution correctly clamps window size between 3-20 as specified.\n\n4. **Conditional Aggregations**: All required aggregations (HIGH_WEIGHT ≥5, LOW_WEIGHT <5, POSITIVE >0, NEGATIVE ≤0) are correctly implemented.\n\n5. **Smoothing**: The optional smoothing feature is correctly implemented based on `SMOOTH_PERCENTILES` environment variable.\n\n**Status**: No missing requirements detected. The solution appears to implement all specified features.\n\n## Traceability Analysis\n\nExamining whether solution.sh can be derived from task.yaml:\n\n1. **Checkpoint Behavior on Restore**: The task says \"After restore, continue processing from the next line\" which the solution implements by incrementing `i` after restore.\n\n2. **Priority Tie Breaking**: Task specifies \"Priority ties are broken by ingest order\" - the solution implements this with the sort key.\n\n3. **Time Decay Reference Point**: Task specifies using \"the timestamp of the most recent timestamped record\" which the solution tracks via `latest_timestamp`.\n\n4. **Percentile Rounding**: Task specifies \"Round percentile values to integers\" which is implemented.\n\n**Status**: The solution appears to be directly derivable from the specification without workarounds.\n\n## Grader Coverage\n\nComparing grader.py tests against task.yaml requirements:\n\n1. **All Core Features**: The grader recomputes the expected output using the same logic as the solution, which means it tests all features implicitly.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**: The grader handles:\n   - Missing files\n   - Incorrect CSV schema\n   - Row count mismatches\n   - Cell-by-cell validation\n\n3. **Smoothing**: The grader correctly reads the `SMOOTH_PERCENTILES` environment variable.\n\n**Status**: The grader appears to comprehensively test all requirements through its reference implementation approach.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nChecking for functionality not specified in task.yaml:\n\n1. The solution includes extensive documentation and comments, which is good practice but not required.\n\n2. No additional functionality beyond the specification was detected.\n\n**Status**: No unauthorized additional features found.\n\n## Grader Quality Audit\n\nEvaluating grader.py's testing approach:\n\n1. **Reference Implementation**: The grader uses a complete reference implementation that mirrors the solution logic, which is thorough but could mask implementation-specific bugs.\n\n2. **Binary Scoring**: The grader returns either 0.0 or 1.0 with no partial credit, which is strict but clear.\n\n3. **Detailed Error Reporting**: The grader provides specific mismatch details (up to 25 examples) which aids debugging.\n\n4. **Schema Validation**: The grader strictly validates the CSV column order and names.\n\n**Status**: The grader is comprehensive but relies heavily on reference implementation matching rather than property-based testing.\n\n## Threshold Justification\n\nExamining hardcoded thresholds:\n\n1. **MIN_WEIGHT = 0.1**: Specified in task.yaml as \"min_weight_threshold = 0.1\"\n2. **Window size 3-20**: Specified in task.yaml\n3. **Weight threshold 5 for HIGH_WEIGHT**: Specified in task.yaml\n4. **DECAY_FACTOR = 0.95**: Specified in task.yaml\n\n**Status**: All thresholds are justified by the specification.\n\n## Gaming Vulnerabilities\n\nAssessing exploitation possibilities:\n\n1. **No Direct Output Access**: Since the grader recomputes everything, agents cannot simply hardcode outputs.\n\n2. **Deterministic Processing**: The task requires deterministic output, reducing gaming opportunities.\n\n3. **Input Validation**: The normalization process prevents malformed input exploitation.\n\n**Status**: The task appears resistant to gaming due to its comprehensive grader approach.\n\n## Non-determinism Handling\n\nEvaluating randomness handling:\n\n1. **Deterministic Requirements**: The task explicitly requires \"Deterministic output only\" and \"no random rounding\".\n\n2. **Stable Sorting**: The solution uses stable sorting with clear tie-breaking rules.\n\n3. **Floating Point**: The solution rounds time decay to 2 decimal places for consistency.\n\n**Status**: Non-determinism is well-handled with explicit deterministic requirements.\n\n## Test Documentation\n\nChecking test case documentation:\n\n1. **Grader Docstrings**: The grader has a comprehensive module docstring explaining its approach.\n\n2. **Function Documentation**: Key functions like `grade()` have clear docstrings.\n\n3. **Test Files**: The task_dockerfile references test files in `/tests/` but these aren't provided for review.\n\n**Status**: Documentation is adequate for the provided files.\n\n## Cheating Risk Assessment\n\nAnalyzing bypass opportunities:\n\nGiven the constraints (no internet, no grader access, no package installation):\n\n1. **Reference Implementation**: Since the grader uses the same algorithm, agents must implement the exact logic.\n\n2. **Complex State Management**: The checkpointing and state restoration make it difficult to fake.\n\n3. **Multi-format Input**: Supporting all input formats correctly is non-trivial.\n\n**Status**: Low cheating risk due to complexity and comprehensive validation.\n\n## Dependency Reproducibility\n\nChecking version pinning:\n\n1. **No External Dependencies**: The solution uses only Python standard library (json, math, csv, os, pathlib, collections, typing, copy).\n\n2. **Grader Dependencies**: Uses pandas but without version specification. The grader has a pydantic shim for compatibility.\n\n**Issue Found**: Pandas is used in the grader without version pinning.\n\n**Status**: Minor issue with unpinned pandas dependency.\n\n## Error/Typo Scan\n\nSearching for typographical errors:\n\n1. **task.yaml**: No typos detected in the extensive specification.\n\n2. **solution.sh**: No typos detected in code or comments.\n\n3. **grader.py**: No typos detected.\n\n**Status**: No typographical errors found.\n\n## File Placement Check\n\nVerifying file locations:\n\n1. **Grader**: Correctly copied to `/tests/grader.py`\n2. **Solution**: Correctly copied to `/tests/solution.sh`\n3. **Data**: Correctly copied to `/workdir/data`\n\n**Status**: All files are placed in appropriate locations.\n\n## Dependency Installation Audit\n\nChecking for test dependencies in image:\n\n1. **Dockerfile**: The placeholder sections for dependencies are empty, which is correct.\n\n2. **Runtime Dependencies**: All required packages (Python standard library) are available in the base image.\n\n**Status**: No inappropriate dependency installation detected.\n\n## Summary of Issues\n\n1. **Minor**: Unpinned pandas dependency in grader (though mitigated by pydantic shim)\n2. **Minor**: Grader uses reference implementation approach rather than property-based testing (though this is comprehensive)\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nThe task is exceptionally well-designed with:\n- Comprehensive and clear specifications\n- Complete implementation of all requirements\n- Thorough grading approach\n- Good resistance to gaming\n- Proper file organization\n\nThe only notable issue is the unpinned pandas dependency in the grader, which is mitigated by the pydantic shim for compatibility. This is not serious enough to reject the task.\n\n<final_verdict>PASS</final_verdict>"

  "arbitrary_thresholds": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader uses binary scoring (1.0 for perfect match, 0.0 otherwise) based on exact string matching of all test cases. This is not arbitrary - it requires complete correctness. The fraud score formula uses specific weights (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.5) but these are part of the task specification, not grading thresholds."
  },
  "reward_hacking_vulnerabilities": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The task is well-protected against gaming. Data files are read-only, the grader recomputes ground truth from source data (not comparing to a static answer), and the container isolation prevents accessing grader.py or modifying test data. Agents must implement the full algorithm correctly."
  },
  "non_deterministic_behavior": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader handles non-determinism well. It uses deterministic sorting (fraud_score desc, then account_id, then campaign_id for tie-breaking), fixed decimal formatting, and consistent minute bucketing for timestamps. The algorithm is fully deterministic given the input data."
  },
  "solution_file_exists": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "solution.sh exists and provides a complete reference implementation that follows the task specification exactly, including all fraud score calculations, eligibility checks, and output formatting."

  "behavior_in_task_description": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "All grader checks are described in the task description: eligibility criteria, fraud score components with exact formulas, sorting/ranking rules, output format with decimal places, and the requirement for exactly 5 rows."
  },
  "behavior_in_tests": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader checks all behaviors from the task description: eligibility filtering, all 4 fraud components calculation, final score formula, sorting/ranking, and exact CSV format with specified decimal places."
  },
  "informative_test_docstrings": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader has comprehensive docstrings explaining what it does, how it validates the solution, and the scoring approach. The main docstring clearly states it's a binary grader checking for exact matches."
  },
  "anti_cheating_measures": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "Strong anti-cheating measures: grader.py is inaccessible, data files are read-only, no internet access, and the grader recomputes ground truth rather than using static answers. Agents must implement the full algorithm."
  },
  "structured_data_schema": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The CSV output schema is precisely defined in the task description with exact header, column order, and decimal formatting requirements for each field."

  "pinned_dependencies": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The task uses only Python standard library (json, csv, datetime, collections, pathlib). No external dependencies need pinning."

  "tests_or_solution_in_image": {
    "outcome": "fail",
    "explanation": "The task_dockerfile copies both solution.sh and grader.py to /tests/ directory in the image. These should not be included in the image as they're meant to be run separately by the harness."

    "explanation": "The task is very clearly described with precise formulas for each fraud component, exact eligibility criteria, detailed sorting rules, and specific output format requirements including decimal places."
  },
  "grader_robustness": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The grader handles edge cases well: division by zero checks, empty data handling, missing fields with fallbacks, and clamping values to valid ranges. It provides helpful feedback for different failure modes."
  },
  "difficulty_alignment": {
    "outcome": "pass",
    "explanation": "The 'hard' difficulty is appropriate. The task requires complex data aggregation across multiple files, implementing 4 different fraud metrics with specific formulas, handling edge cases, and precise output formatting. The 45-120 minute time estimates are reasonable."

    "explanation": "I'll analyze this task thoroughly to identify any mistakes across the different categories.\n\n## Understanding the Task\n\nThis is a fraud detection task for advertising campaigns. The task requires:\n1. Loading JSON data files containing campaigns, impressions, clicks, conversions, and IP metadata\n2. Filtering campaigns based on eligibility criteria (active, spend ≥ 500, impressions ≥ 2000)\n3. Computing 4 fraud components with specific formulas\n4. Calculating a weighted fraud score\n5. Selecting the top 5 campaigns by fraud score\n6. Outputting results to a CSV file with specific formatting\n\nLet me analyze each category of potential mistakes:\n\n## Requirements Compliance\n\nAfter careful analysis, the solution.sh appears to correctly implement all requirements:\n- ✓ Loads all JSON files correctly\n- ✓ Implements eligibility filters (active, spend_last_30d ≥ 500, impressions ≥ 2000)\n- ✓ Computes all 4 fraud components according to specifications\n- ✓ Calculates fraud_score with correct weights (4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.5)\n- ✓ Sorts by fraud_score descending with tie-breaking by account_id, campaign_id\n- ✓ Outputs exactly 5 rows with correct header and formatting\n\n**Status: PASS** - All requirements are implemented correctly.\n\n## Traceability Analysis\n\nThe solution can be derived from task.yaml with one minor ambiguity:\n- The specification for `expected_ctr` when using `average_ctr_by_channel` states: \"expected_ctr = arithmetic mean of ALL its values (not weighted)\"\n- The solution correctly interprets this as `sum(values)/len(values)`\n- The grader.py confirms this interpretation\n\n**Status: PASS** - Solution is traceable from specifications.\n\n## Grader Coverage\n\nThe grader.py thoroughly tests:\n- ✓ File existence\n- ✓ CSV header correctness\n- ✓ Exactly 5 data rows\n- ✓ Decimal formatting (2dp for spend, 3dp for others)\n- ✓ Exact string matching of all values\n- ✓ Correct ordering and ranking\n\nThe grader recomputes the entire solution from scratch, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n**Status: PASS** - Grader covers all requirements.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe solution.sh includes:\n- `ip_meta = load(\"ip_metadata.json\")` with comment \"optional not used by formula\"\n\nThis is acceptable as the task requires reading all files, even if ip_metadata.json isn't used in calculations.\n\n**Status: PASS** - No unauthorized additional features.\n\n## Grader Quality Audit\n\nThe grader:\n- ✓ Recomputes ground truth independently\n- ✓ Uses exact string comparison after formatting\n- ✓ Provides helpful feedback on failures\n- ✓ Returns proper GradingResult structure\n- ✓ Handles edge cases (division by zero, empty data)\n\n**Status: PASS** - Grader quality is excellent.\n\n## Threshold Justification\n\nHardcoded thresholds in the task:\n- `spend_last_30d ≥ 500` - Justified as eligibility criterion\n- `2000 impressions` - Justified as eligibility criterion\n- `>5 clicks` for burst detection - Justified in rapid_fire_clicks definition\n- `0.02` default expected CTR - Justified as fallback\n- `0.05` default expected conversion rate - Justified as fallback\n\n**Status: PASS** - All thresholds are justified in specifications.\n\n## Gaming Vulnerabilities\n\nGiven container constraints:\n- Data files are read-only\n- No internet access\n- grader.py is inaccessible to solution\n- The grader recomputes everything from scratch\n\nNo gaming vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Status: PASS** - Task is secure against gaming.\n\n## Non-determinism Handling\n\nThe task is deterministic:\n- File reading order doesn't matter (data is aggregated)\n- Sorting is deterministic with proper tie-breaking\n- No random elements or timing dependencies\n\n**Status: PASS** - Non-determinism is properly handled.\n\n## Test Documentation\n\nThe grader.py includes:\n- ✓ Comprehensive docstring explaining what it tests\n- ✓ Clear comments throughout\n- ✓ Helpful feedback messages\n\n**Status: PASS** - Well documented.\n\n## Cheating Risk Assessment\n\nGiven constraints:\n- Cannot modify data files (read-only)\n- Cannot access grader.py\n- Cannot install packages\n- Must produce exact output format\n\nNo cheating opportunities identified.\n\n**Status: PASS** - Low cheating risk.\n\n## Dependency Reproducibility\n\nThe task uses only Python standard library - no external dependencies to pin.\n\n**Status: PASS** - No dependency issues.\n\n## Error/Typo Scan\n\nFound one issue:\n- In task_dockerfile, there are TWO copies of solution.sh at the end:\n  ```dockerfile\n  </task_dockerfile>\n  \n  <solution.sh>\n  #!/usr/bin/env bash\n  ...\n  </solution.sh>\n  ```\n  This appears to be a copy-paste error where solution.sh content was duplicated after the dockerfile closing tag.\n\n**Status: FAIL** - Duplicate solution.sh content after dockerfile.\n\n## File Placement Check\n\nThe dockerfile correctly copies files to `/tests/`:\n```dockerfile\nCOPY ./solution.sh /tests/\nCOPY ./grader.py /tests/\n```\n\n**Status: PASS** - Files placed correctly.\n\n## Dependency Installation Audit\n\nThe dockerfile has empty placeholder sections for dependencies, which is correct since only standard library is used.\n\n**Status: PASS** - No inappropriate dependency installation.\n\n## Summary of Issues\n\n1. **Critical Issue**: Duplicate solution.sh content appears after the task_dockerfile closing tag. This is a formatting/structure error in the task definition file.\n\n2. **Minor observations** (not errors):\n   - The task loads ip_metadata.json but doesn't use it (acknowledged in solution comment)\n   - The grader includes a pydantic shim for compatibility\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nThe task is well-designed and thoroughly tested. The implementation correctly follows all specifications, and the grader provides comprehensive validation. The only issue is the duplicate solution.sh content after the dockerfile, which appears to be a copy-paste error in the task definition structure.\n\nThis structural error with the duplicate solution.sh content is serious enough to require correction before the task can be properly processed, as it violates the expected format of the task definition.\n\n<final_verdict>FAIL</final_verdict>"

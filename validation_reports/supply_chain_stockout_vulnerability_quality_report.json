  "qualit_save_quality_report_check_results": {
    "arbitrary_thresholds": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The grader uses binary scoring (1.0 for exact match, 0.0 otherwise) which is clearly justified - the task requires finding exactly 5 SKUs with specific calculations. All thresholds in the task (lead_time_days >= 3, mean_daily_demand >= 5, etc.) are part of the business logic requirements, not arbitrary grading thresholds."
    },
    "reward_hacking_vulnerabilities": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The task is well-protected against gaming. Data files are read-only, agents cannot modify them. The grader recomputes ground truth from the same data files, so hardcoding outputs would require reverse-engineering the exact calculations. The container isolation prevents accessing grader.py or installing packages."
    },
    "non_deterministic_behavior": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The grader handles non-determinism well. It uses deterministic calculations, has clear tie-breaking rules (sort by vulnerability_score desc, then category asc, then sku_id asc), and uses population standard deviation with a fixed rule for zero variance (use 0.5). The numeric comparison allows for floating-point precision issues."
    },
    "solution_file_exists": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "solution.sh exists and provides a complete reference implementation that follows the exact specification, including all calculations, eligibility checks, and output formatting."
    },
    "behavior_in_task_description": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "All behavior checked by the grader is clearly described in the task description, including eligibility criteria, formulas for all metrics, sorting rules, output format, and decimal precision requirements."
    },
    "behavior_in_tests": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The grader checks all behavior described in the task: eligibility filters, metric calculations, sorting order, exact 5 rows, CSV format, header match, decimal precision, and rank sequence 1-5."
    },
    "informative_test_docstrings": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The grader has comprehensive docstrings explaining what it checks, including the main module docstring that lists all validation steps and the grade() function that documents the scoring approach."
    },
    "anti_cheating_measures": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "Strong anti-cheating measures: read-only data files, no internet access, grader.py inaccessible, cannot install packages. The task requires complex calculations that would be difficult to reverse-engineer without understanding the business logic."
    },
    "structured_data_schema": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The CSV output schema is precisely defined in the task description with exact header, column order, data types, and decimal precision for each field."
    },
    "pinned_dependencies": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The task uses only Python standard library (json, csv, math, statistics) with no external dependencies, ensuring reproducibility."
    },
    "typos": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "No typos found. File names, variable names, and text are all correctly spelled and consistent throughout."
    },
    "tests_or_solution_in_image": {
      "outcome": "fail",
      "explanation": "The task_dockerfile copies both solution.sh and grader.py to /tests/ directory in the image. These should not be included in the image as they are meant to be run separately by the harness."
    },
    "test_deps_in_image": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "No test-specific dependencies are installed in the image. The task uses only standard Python libraries."
    },
    "task_clarity": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The task is exceptionally clear with precise formulas, explicit eligibility criteria, detailed calculation steps, exact output format requirements, and clear tie-breaking rules."
    },
    "grader_robustness": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The grader is robust: validates file existence, header format, row count, numeric formatting, handles edge cases (empty data, zero variance), uses tolerant numeric comparison, and provides detailed error messages."
    },
    "difficulty_alignment": {
      "outcome": "pass",
      "explanation": "The 'hard' difficulty is appropriate given the complexity: multiple data sources, complex eligibility criteria, statistical calculations, multiple metrics to combine, and precise formatting requirements. The 25-60 minute time estimates seem reasonable."

      "explanation": "I'll analyze this supply chain stockout vulnerability task thoroughly for mistakes across all the specified categories.\n\n## Understanding the Task\n\nThis task requires finding the top 5 SKUs with highest vulnerability to stockout based on:\n1. Eligibility criteria (lead time ≥3, mean daily demand ≥5, active flag, distributed across ≥2 warehouses)\n2. Four vulnerability components calculated with specific formulas\n3. A weighted total vulnerability score\n4. Specific output formatting requirements\n\nLet me analyze each category of potential mistakes:\n\n## Requirements Compliance\n\nThe solution.sh appears to implement all requirements correctly:\n- ✓ Reads all 4 JSON files\n- ✓ Applies all eligibility filters\n- ✓ Calculates all 4 vulnerability components with correct formulas\n- ✓ Computes total vulnerability score with correct weights\n- ✓ Sorts by score desc, then category asc, then sku_id asc\n- ✓ Outputs exactly 5 rows with correct formatting\n- ✓ Uses population standard deviation (not sample)\n- ✓ Handles the special case when stddev=0 → use 0.5\n\n**Status: PASS** - All requirements are implemented correctly.\n\n## Traceability Analysis\n\nThe solution can be derived from task.yaml with one minor ambiguity:\n- The task specifies \"next 30 days\" for demand forecast but doesn't explicitly state what to do if less than 30 days are available\n- The solution handles this by requiring exactly 30 days (`if len(dd) < 30: continue`)\n- The grader also enforces this same interpretation\n\n**Status: PASS** - The solution is traceable to the specification with reasonable interpretation of edge cases.\n\n## Grader Coverage\n\nThe grader thoroughly tests:\n- ✓ File existence and structure\n- ✓ Exact header match\n- ✓ Exactly 5 rows\n- ✓ Rank sequence 1-5\n- ✓ Correct sorting order\n- ✓ Decimal precision for each numeric column\n- ✓ Recomputes ground truth using same logic\n- ✓ Value-by-value comparison with numeric tolerance\n\n**Status: PASS** - The grader comprehensively tests all requirements.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nNo additional features detected in solution.sh beyond what's specified in task.yaml.\n\n**Status: PASS** - Solution implements exactly what's required.\n\n## Grader Quality Audit\n\nThe grader is well-designed:\n- Uses binary scoring (1.0 for perfect match, 0.0 otherwise) which is appropriate for this deterministic task\n- Implements the same computation logic as the solution\n- Has proper numeric tolerance handling with `_approx_equal_num`\n- Validates both structure and values\n- Good error messages for debugging\n\nOne minor observation: The grader has defensive checks for ground truth producing exactly 5 rows, which is good practice.\n\n**Status: PASS** - High-quality grader that properly enforces requirements.\n\n## Threshold Justification\n\nAll thresholds in the task are clearly specified:\n- lead_time_days ≥ 3\n- mean_daily_demand ≥ 5\n- distributed across ≥ 2 warehouses\n- 1.65 multiplier for safety stock (standard z-score for 95% service level)\n- Weights for vulnerability components (2.5, 1.8, 2.0, 3.0)\n\n**Status: PASS** - All thresholds are justified or industry-standard.\n\n## Gaming Vulnerabilities\n\nGiven container constraints:\n- Data files are read-only\n- No internet access\n- grader.py is inaccessible to agents\n- The task is deterministic with exact expected output\n\nNo gaming vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Status: PASS** - Task is secure against gaming.\n\n## Non-determinism Handling\n\nThe task is fully deterministic:\n- JSON parsing order is handled by explicit indexing\n- Sorting has complete tie-breaker rules\n- No random elements\n- Numeric calculations are deterministic\n\n**Status: PASS** - No non-determinism issues.\n\n## Test Documentation\n\nThe grader has excellent documentation:\n- Comprehensive module docstring explaining the grading approach\n- Clear comments throughout\n- Function docstrings for key functions\n- Detailed error messages\n\n**Status: PASS** - Well-documented grader.\n\n## Cheating Risk Assessment\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- Cannot modify read-only data files\n- Cannot access grader.py\n- Cannot install packages\n- Must produce exact output\n\nThe only way to \"cheat\" would be to hardcode the output, but this would require knowing the exact data, which changes per test case.\n\n**Status: PASS** - Low cheating risk.\n\n## Dependency Reproducibility\n\nThe task uses only Python standard library (json, math, csv, statistics, pathlib, collections). No external dependencies to pin.\n\n**Status: PASS** - No dependency issues.\n\n## Error/Typo Scan\n\nFound one issue:\n- **DUPLICATE**: The solution.sh appears twice in the provided content (identical copies)\n\nNo other typos or errors found in the code or specifications.\n\n**Status: MINOR ISSUE** - Duplicate solution.sh in submission.\n\n## File Placement Check\n\nExamining the Dockerfile:\n```dockerfile\nCOPY ./solution.sh /tests/\nCOPY ./grader.py /tests/\n```\n\n**CRITICAL ERROR**: Both solution.sh and grader.py are being copied to `/tests/` directory, which should be root-only. However, the task expects the agent to create `/workdir/sol.csv`, not run solution.sh. The solution.sh should not be accessible to the agent at all - it's meant to be a reference solution for the task creator.\n\n**Status: FAIL** - Solution file incorrectly placed in container.\n\n## Dependency Installation Audit\n\nThe Dockerfile has placeholder sections but doesn't install any test-specific dependencies, which is correct since only standard library is used.\n\n**Status: PASS** - No inappropriate dependency installations.\n\n## Summary of Issues\n\n1. **CRITICAL**: solution.sh is copied into the container at `/tests/solution.sh`, making the reference solution accessible to agents\n2. **MINOR**: solution.sh appears twice in the provided content (likely a copy-paste error)\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nThe task itself is well-designed with clear requirements, comprehensive grading, and proper implementation. However, there is a critical security issue where the reference solution is being copied into the container where it could potentially be accessed by agents, even though `/tests/` is supposed to be root-only.\n\nThis is a serious enough issue to require fixing before the task can be accepted, as it compromises the integrity of the evaluation.\n\n<final_verdict>FAIL</final_verdict>"

  You're given a large multi-modal logistics network (`/workdir/data/graph.json`) with stochastic travel times and costs whose parameters depend on fuel, congestion, and weather conditions. A tight deadline (in hours) and a quadratic delay penalty are provided in `/workdir/data/params.json`.

  **Objective:** Compute the path from origin to destination that minimizes the expected total cost, where:
    
    total_cost = expected transport cost + expected quadratic deadline penalty

  **Input Files:**
  
  1. **`/workdir/data/graph.json`**: Network structure with nodes and edges
     - Each edge has: mode, distance_km, base_time_mean_h, base_time_cv, fuel_rate_l_per_km, 
       handling_fee, congestion_sensitivity, weather_sensitivity
  
  2. **`/workdir/data/params.json`**: Problem parameters
     - `origin`: Starting node (e.g., "A")
     - `destination`: Target node (e.g., "Z")
     - `deadline_h`: Time deadline in hours
     - `penalty_lambda`: Penalty coefficient for deadline violations
     - `fuel_price_usd_per_litre`: Fuel cost per liter
     - `congestion_index`: Congestion level (0-1 scale)
     - `weather_disruption_prob`: Weather impact probability (0-1 scale)
     - `mc_samples`: Number of Monte Carlo samples for simulation (typically 1500)
     - `rng_seed`: Random seed for reproducibility

  **Key Details:**
  
  • **Travel Time Distribution:** Each edge's travel time follows a LogNormal distribution with mean:
      
      adjusted_mean = base_time_mean_h 
                      × (1 + congestion_sensitivity × congestion_index)
                      × (1 + weather_sensitivity × weather_disruption_prob)
      
    and coefficient of variation (CoV) = base_time_cv
    
  • **Transport Cost:** For each edge:
      
      cost = handling_fee + (fuel_rate_l_per_km × distance_km × fuel_price_usd_per_litre)
      
  • **Path Time:** Sum of independent edge times
  
  • **Delay Penalty:** 
      
      penalty = penalty_lambda × E[(max(0, path_time - deadline_h))²]
      
  • **Mode Flexibility:** You can freely switch between transportation modes (road/rail/air/sea) at any node

  **Challenge Factors:**
  - The graph has 30 nodes and 100+ edges, requiring efficient path exploration
  - **Very tight deadline** (12 hours) relative to feasible path times
  - **Extremely high** congestion (0.9) and weather disruption (0.25) probabilities
  - **Very high** penalty coefficient (λ=8.0) makes deadline violations extremely costly
  - Higher fuel costs increase pressure on route selection
  - More Monte Carlo samples (1500) required for accuracy
  - Stochastic travel times with high variance require sophisticated optimization
  - Multiple competing objectives: minimize cost, minimize time, minimize risk

  **Output Format:**
  Write your solution to `/workdir/sol.csv` with the following headers:
  - `path_nodes`: semicolon-separated node IDs (e.g., "A;C;G;Z")
  - `path_modes`: semicolon-separated transportation modes (e.g., "road;rail;rail")
  - `expected_cost`: float representing the expected total cost
  - `p_delay`: float representing the probability of missing the deadline

  **Constraints:**
  • No internet access
  • Python standard library only (no external packages)
  • **CRITICAL**: Must use `rng_seed` from params.json for reproducibility
  • **CRITICAL**: Must use `mc_samples` from params.json for Monte Carlo simulation
  • Path must be valid (all edges must exist in the graph)
  • Path must start at origin and end at destination

  **Hints:**
  - Consider using K-shortest paths algorithms to explore candidate routes
  - Use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected penalty and delay probability
  - Balance transport cost against deadline penalty when selecting paths
  - The LogNormal distribution can be parameterized from mean and CoV
  
  **Implementation Notes:**
  - Read all parameters from params.json (origin, destination, deadline_h, penalty_lambda, 
    fuel_price_usd_per_litre, congestion_index, weather_disruption_prob, mc_samples, rng_seed)
  - Use `random.seed(rng_seed)` before any random sampling
  - Run exactly `mc_samples` Monte Carlo iterations for each path candidate
  - The grader will validate results using the same parameters and random seed
